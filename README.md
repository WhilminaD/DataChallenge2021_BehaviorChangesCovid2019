## Background
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends staying at home during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Beginning in March-April 2020, most of the states mandated a statewide stay-at-home order to help stop the spread of Covid-19 and it is of great importance to leave homes only when necessary. States’ officials announced that people are “required to stay home except to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or go to an essential job. We, a group of researchers at the University of Maryland, designed a survey to investigate the influence of the pandemic and these statewide orders on the way people travel to meet their essential needs, do their routine daily exercises, and get to work—if employed in an essential service sector. Monitoring and analysis of the changes in travel behavior and the level of physical activity would be beneficial in many ways; it would help for a more efficient and comprehensive analysis of the various impacts the current situation has on transportation needs, and physical and mental health, and would help us better plan and manage future situations.
